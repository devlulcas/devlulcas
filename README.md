## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Lucas

I'm a Software Developer from Brazil. I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer at [**@DantasBikes**](https://dantasbikes.com.br/), where I'm part of the team responsible for the development of the e-commerce platform and other systems.

I've built a lot of things with **Typescript** using libraries like **React** and frameworks like **NextJS**, **Svelte**, **SvelteKit**, and **NestJS** for more backend-oriented stuff.
Although TS is the tool I use every day, I also have knowledge of **PHP**, **Go** and **Elixir**.
